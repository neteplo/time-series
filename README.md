# financial-time-series

Repository containts two mini-projects on time series analysis topic. 

* The first project (fin_ts.ipynb) is dedicated to the prediction of electricity consumption in the central district of St. Petersburg. Data represents the historical values of electricity consumption at different times of the year. The time series was decomposed into trend, seasonality, and non-deterministic components. The seasonality is modeled by a harmonic function. After that, the ARMA and ARIMA models were fitted.

* Seond one is dedicated to the prediction of one of the Prisma stores in SPb using SARIMAX model. The hyperparameters tuning was performed using grid-search on validation sub-set.
